# Stopwatch
This is an animated stopwatch application which features two hands that make full rotations per minute and per second. A projected shadow is implemented with matrix multiplication of the original clock hands and a shadow matrix. The shadow of the watch can also be altered using 'Q''W''E''A''S''D' keys, which change the values of the light source.
